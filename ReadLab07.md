## REST:

 - what is a __protocol__?
   - it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.
   - You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
   
   - __The whole world wide web__ is built on an architectural style called __“REST”__. 
   - __REST__ provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
   - __A web page__ is a “representation” of a resource.
   - __URLs__ tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere.
   - __A browser__ can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.
   
   - __“Web Services”__ or __"APIs"__:is that machines could use the web just like people do.
     - which means computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.
     
   - __redirect__:is a technique for moving visitors to a different Web page than the one they request,
     usually, because the page requested is unavailable.  
     
   - __polymorphism__: can be applied to many different nouns. Some verbs are more specific than others and apply only to a small set of nouns.
     - But some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.
   - __HTTP__ is all about applying verbs to nouns. 
     - the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.
     - is actually a general-purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns.
     - __HTTP POST__:to add something to another system.
     - __HTTP PUT__:to replace something in another system or to do a partial update.
   -   software developers work on now to Decide how to best model the data thanks almost entirely to RESTful web frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
