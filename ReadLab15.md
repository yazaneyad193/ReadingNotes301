## Silicon Valley’s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago


* It’s no secret that there is a pronounced gender gap in technology fields.
* In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male.
* In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

* But things haven’t always been this way.
* The numbers of enrollments among men and women in computer science were on their way toward parity in the 1970s and early 1980s.
* In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women, but those numbers began to drop dramatically in the middle of the decade.
* By 2016, that number had been whittled down to 18%.
* This dip in the 1980s has created a chasm that the past 30 years hasn’t been able to overcome—and the dude-centric computer marketing campaigns of that time may be to blame.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

* Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.
* And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
* At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts.
* Here are five themes that have emerged from those conversations: 

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
2. Diverse companies perform better
3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 
5. It’s the right thing to do
